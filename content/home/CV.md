**Matheus Cardoso** is a computer science student at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
He currently internships in the University of Brasília's bioinformatics and immunology laboratory,
conducting research in the area of monoclonal antibodies.

His research seeks to develop a software that analyzes phage display libraries and returns,
as a result, the most efficiently enriched antibodies,
thus providing tools for future research in vaccine development.

Previously, he studied Biotechnology at University of Brasília, 
where he discovered the field of Bioinformatics and his passion for programming.
